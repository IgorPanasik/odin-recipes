	<h2>Description</h2>

	<p>If you're a fan of our banana bread, then you're gonna love this, since it's based on that recipe. As <i>easy</i>
		as that
		is to make, these are even easier. I really think that this threads the needle between something that has the flavor
		of banana bread, but that is very close to the texture of a classic pancake. Top with butter and banana slices and
		serve with warm maple syrup.
	</p>
	<p>Anyway, whether you enjoy these tricked-up for dessert or as-is for breakfast, I really do <strong>hope</strong>
		you give these a
		try soon. <em>Enjoy</em>!

	<h2>How to Make Lasagna Step-By-Step </h2>
	<ol>
		<li><strong>Steps 1:</strong>
			<ul>
				<li>Combine flour, salt, baking powder, and baking soda in a small bowl with a whisk. Reserve until needed.</li>
			</ul>
		</li>

		<li><strong>Step 2:</strong>
			<ul>
				<li>Place banana in a mixing bowl and <strong>mash</strong> into a smooth paste with a potato masher. Add egg
					and
					sugar and whisk
					thoroughly until sugar is dissolved and mixture is smooth and creamy, about <strong>2 minutes</strong>. Add
					milk, vanilla
					extract,
					<strong>&#188;</strong> cup melted butter, walnuts, and flour mixture. Whisk until just combined.
				</li>
			</ul>
		</li>

		<li><strong>Step 3:
				<ul>
					<li>Let batter rest for <strong>10 minutes</strong>. </li>
				</ul>
			</strong>
		</li>

		<li><strong>Step 4:</strong>
			<ul>
				<li>Melt <strong>1</strong> tablespoon butter in a large, nonstick pan or skillet over medium-high heat. Once
					the pan is hot,
					transfer in about <strong>&#8531;</strong> cup of the batter per pancake. Reduce heat to medium and cook until
					edges start to look
					dry
					and small air bubbles pop up through the surface, about <strong>3 minutes</strong>. Flip and cook until
					golden
					brown, <strong>about 3
						minutes more</strong>. Serve <em>immediately</em>. </li>
			</ul>
		</li>
	</ol>

	<p>While an <i>almost-black</i> banana is recommended here, as long as your banana is fully ripe, and you're able to
		mash it
		fairly smooth, it should still work for this recipe.

		If you want these a little more <i>decadent</i>, sprinkle on a little chopped dark chocolate before you flip the
		pancakes â€”
		which, of course, is the <i>secret</i> ingredient in our famous banana bread recipe. </p>
	<p><em>Enjoy!</em></p>
